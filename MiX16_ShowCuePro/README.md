## Remote Layout for MiX16 ShowCue and TouchOSC
This is a template for [MiX16 App ShowCuePro](https://mix16showcue.com/) forTouchOSC...

TouchOSC can be downloaded from the [Hexler Website](https://hexler.net/touchosc)...   

---
#### The latest Version is  V2.5   

We now have full and rich Feedback by OSC. ShowCue-Pro Version should be at least V4.8 (otherwise you will miss some OSC-Feedback-Datas !!

OSC-Control must be activated in the MiX16 Show-Cue parameters-setup !   
The IP-Addresses and the OSC INPUT and OUTPUT Ports must be set correctly in both : TouchOSC and MiX16 Show Cue !  
If the two Apps are on the same computer the IP-Address should be : 127.0.0.1 ...  
In the pics folder you'll see some images of how to configure Show-Cue and TouchOSC; I used the ports 7200 and 7201... but you can use any free port that is not in use otherwise !

I sometimes update some of these Layouts, so  it may be worth to [come back here](https://github.com/ziginfo/TouchOSC-Layouts/tree/main/MiX16_ShowCuePro) from time to time, to see if there are any updates (usually notified in the Readme-Files).     
Please contact me if you have any suggestions or requests and any help is always welcome !

Have Fun
