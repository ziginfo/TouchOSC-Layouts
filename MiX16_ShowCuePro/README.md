## Remote Layout for MiX16 ShowCue and TouchOSC
This is a template for the [MiX16-APPS PRO and GO](/www.mix16apps.com/) forTouchOSC...

TouchOSC can be downloaded from the [Hexler Website](https://hexler.net/touchosc)...  

---
OSC-Control must be activated in the MiX16 Show-Cue parameters-setup !   
The IP-Addresses and the OSC INPUT and OUTPUT Ports must be set correctly in both : TouchOSC and MiX16 Show Cue !  If both are on the same computer the IP-Address should be : 127.0.0.1 ...

I sometimes update some of these Layouts, so  it may be worth to [come back here](https://github.com/ziginfo/TouchOSC-Layouts/tree/main/MiX16_ShowCuePro) from time to time, to see if there are any updates (usually notified in the Readme-Files).     
Please contact me if you have any suggestions or requests and any help is always welcome !

Have Fun
