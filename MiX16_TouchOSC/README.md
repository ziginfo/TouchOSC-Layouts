## TouchOSC Layout for MiX16Apps
Mix16 has already some global OSC-commands implemented, but in general, OSC-Commands are freely mappable ! This is done in the MIDI-Editor of MiX16Apps, where you can mapp MIDI and OSC-Commands     
In order to use this TouchOSC-layout with the MiX16Apps, you must first import the midi-mapping file ("MiX16 v9.1 mapping for TouchOSC.mix16pmm") in the MiX16App ! To do this, just go to the "Tools-Men"u and open "MIDI-Editor" and than click on "Open-File"  (see the screenshots)

Please contact me if you have any suggestions or requests and any help is always welcome !!

Have Fun
