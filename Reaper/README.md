## Reaper  Control and Feedback with TouchOSC    
This Template is based on [Alberto Valdez](https://github.com/AlbertoV5) Reaper Templates
OSC ports are set by default ! Reaper is listening on Port 7000 and sending Feedback on Port 9000 ; so in TouchOSC the ports must be set to : Input Port : 9000 and Output Port : 7000    
Remote Control and Feedback can be by Localhost (127.0.0.1) or any private Network (Wi-Fi Routers etc)
