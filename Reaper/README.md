## Reaper  Control and Feedback with TouchOSC    
This Template is based on the Reaper Templates from [Alberto Valdez](https://github.com/AlbertoV5) ...
OSC ports are set by default ! Reaper is listening on Port **7000** and sending Feedback on Port **9000** ; so in TouchOSC the ports must be set to : Receive Port : **9000** and Send Port : **7000**  And please use **Connection 2** (as connection 1 will be used for ReaLearn)        
Remote Control and Feedback can be by Localhost (127.0.0.1) or any private Network (Wi-Fi Routers etc)

#### The latest Version is  V2.0

Please contact me if you have any suggestions, demands or requests and any help is always welcome !!   
Have Fun ...  

Special Thanks to [Alberto Valdez](https://github.com/AlbertoV5) for his TouchOSC-Remote-Scripts
