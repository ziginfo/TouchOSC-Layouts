## QLab  Control and Feedback with TouchOSC

OSC ports are set by default ! QLab is listening on Port 53000 and sending Feedback on Port 53001 ; so in TouchOSC the ports must be set to : Input Port : 53001 and Output Port : 53000

Please contact me if you have any suggestions, demands or requests and any help is always welcome !!   
Have Fun ...
