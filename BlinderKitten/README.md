## BlinderKitten  Control and Feedback with TouchOSC   
OSC ports are set by default ! BlinderKitten is listening on Port **42000** ; so in TouchOSC the ports must be set to  Output Port : **42000**    
OSC Feedback is now available; thanks to the developper [Norbert Rostaing](https://github.com/norbertrostaing/)
