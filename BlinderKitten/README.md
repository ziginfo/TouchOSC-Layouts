## BlinderKitten  Control and Feedback with TouchOSC   
OSC ports are set by default ! BlinderKitten is listening on Port **42000** ; so in TouchOSC the ports must be set to  Output Port : **42000**    
OSC Feedback is actually not available; but should be sent on port  42001 once it will be implemented by the developper [Norbert Rostaing](https://github.com/norbertrostaing/)

Please note also that this TouchOSC-Layout is still in developpement (October 2024) and many features may not work correctly or not work at all... so please be patient and send me a message about bugs and issues... and come back here to look after newer versions

#### The actuel Version is  V1.5   
You can have feedback by MIDI and/or SysEx. Please use any virtual MIDI-Port for this....and you must creat e a virtual MIDI-Interface in BlinderKitten (or import the "SysExText.mochi")
