## BlinderKitten  Control and Feedback with TouchOSC   
OSC ports are set by default ! BlinderKitten is listening on Port **42000** ; so in TouchOSC the ports must be set to  Output Port : **42000**    
OSC Feedback is actually not available; but should be sent on port  **43001** once it will be implemented by the developper [Norbert Rostaing](https://github.com/norbertrostaing/)

Please note also that this TouchOSC-Layout is still in developpement (October 2024) and many features may not work at correctly or not work at all... so please be patient and comme back from time to time to see what's new
