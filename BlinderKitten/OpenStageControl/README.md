## BlinderKitten  Remote Control and Feedback with OpenStageControl  
OSC ports are set by default ! BlinderKitten is listening on Port **42000** ; so in OpenStageControl the ports must be set to  Output Port : **42000**    
OSC Feedback is actually not available; but should be sent on port  42001 once it will be implemented by the developper [Norbert Rostaing](https://github.com/norbertrostaing/)      
For the access to the Web-Server the default port is 8080 (for exemple 127.0.0.1:8080) ... but you can set any other desired port in the OpenStageControl-Setup !
