## BlinderKitten  Remote Control and Feedback with OpenStageControl  
OSC-Feedback is now available in BlinderKitten via a virtual interface module. Tanks to the developper [Norbert Rostaing](https://github.com/norbertrostaing/) for the OSC-Feedback Implementation !   
In BlinderKitten, you can activate a blank module (in "**Interfaces**" -> "**+**" -> "**OSC**") or by importing a preconfigured mochi, that already contains quite a few mappings and feedbacks (**OSC-MappingV1.mochi**)
At ​​the simplest just use the default ports, i.e. for Input the port **13000** and for Output the **13001**! In TouchOSC this must therefore be corresponding: Send-Port is **13000** and Receive Port is **13001**

The "standard" module of the BlinderKitten's GUI (in the Preferences) can be used or not, but in any case the ports must be different (I advise to keep 42000 and 45000 for example)

For the access to the Web-Server the default port is 8080... but you can set any other desired port in the OpenStageControl-Setup !
