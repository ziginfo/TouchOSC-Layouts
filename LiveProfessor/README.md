## TouchOSC Layout for LiveProfessor
In TouchOSC, the Default ports are set to  8000 (OUT) and 8001 (IN). But this can be changed in the preferences of LiveProfessor!

There are many Global OSC-Commands within LiveProfessor, but the real power of the Remote-Function is that all can be mapped and tweaked as desired by individual mapping...!   
But this means also that the OSC-configuration (and its implementation) can change from one Project-File to another !    
 
A good starting point may be, to use my "Basic-Empty-Session" where some basic OSC-Commands are already mapped in ! If you wanna start from scratch you can also open a "New Project" and than import my "Basic-OSC-configuration.ctrl2" file which will give you already a basic OSC-Implementation !   
To do this, just download the file "Basic-OSC-configuration.ctrl2"; and import it to "Hardware Controller Setup" of LiveProfessor (see the screen captures) ... Note that you than have to mapp every single Controller to a given Function ! Once again : the Project-File "Basic_Empty.rack2" has already these controllers and some basic Function-Mappings....     
Please contact me if you have demands or requests and any help is always welcome !!

Have Fun
