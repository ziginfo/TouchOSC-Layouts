## Ableton Live  Control and Feedback with TouchOSC

To get this OSC-Module run correctly, you must first donwload and install the free [AbletonOSC](https://github.com/ideoforms/AbletonOSC) Remote-Script and than activate it in Ableton Live !!   

OSC ports are set by default ! Ableton Live is listening on Port 11000 and sending Feedback on Port 11001 ; so in TouchOSC the ports must be set to : Input Port : 53001 and Output Port : 53000    
Remote Control and Feedback can be by Localhost (127.0.0.1) or any private Network (Wi-Fi Routers etc)  

This Layout is still not finished yet ans many things may not work !  I will add some more features in the future. Takes a while to get it done as the OSC-library is quite complexe. 

Please contact me if you have any suggestions, demands or requests and any help is always welcome !!   
Have Fun ...
